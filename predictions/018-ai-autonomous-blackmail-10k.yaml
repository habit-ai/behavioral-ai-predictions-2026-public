baseline: 'As of Jan 2026: No confirmed case of autonomous AI blackmail for material gain. Some reports of AI systems making
  threats or erratic behavior (ChatGPT, Bing, Replika), but none confirmed as goal-directed blackmail resulting in financial
  loss. Metaculus community prices similar question at 80% for EOY 2028 (longer timeframe).'

  (4) resulted in ≥$1,000 USD equivalent loss. NO: No such credible report by Dec 31, 2026.'
