question: An AI system will be credibly reported to have autonomously turned $1,000 USD or more into at least $2,000 (2x return)
  through non-trading activities by December 31, 2026.
short_name: AI Autonomously Earns $1K+
category: AI Capabilities
baseline: 'As of Jan 2026: No verified case of an AI autonomously earning significant money outside of financial trading.
  AI agents can access APIs and wallets but documented income generation (freelance work, selling services/products, advertising
  revenue, etc.) by a self-directed AI remains unconfirmed.'
resolution_criteria: 'YES: Credible source reports an AI that: (1) Autonomously doubled equivalent of ≥$1,000 USD through
  legitimate non-trading activities (e.g., freelance work, content creation revenue, selling digital products, providing services),
  (2) Made its own decisions about how to earn money (not following a human''s step-by-step instructions), (3) Received payment
  into an account it can access. Stock/crypto/financial trading does NOT count.

  NO: No such credible report by Dec 31, 2026.'
