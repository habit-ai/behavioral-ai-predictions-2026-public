question: AI be able to generate a feature length high-quality film based on one prompt (one-shot)
short_name: AI One-Shot Feature Film
category: AI Capabilities
baseline: 'As of Jan 2026: AI video generators (Sora, Runway, Kling) produce clips up to ~1-5 minutes. No demonstration of
  coherent 90+ minute narrative from single prompt. Current workflow requires extensive scene-by-scene prompting, human editing,
  and stitching.'
resolution_criteria: 'YES: A single AI system produces a 90+ minute narrative film from one initial text prompt (no iterative
  prompting or human scene-by-scene direction). Minor human post-processing (color grading, sound mixing) is allowed; human-directed
  scene editing, re-prompting, or stitching separately-generated segments is NOT allowed.

  NO: No such film demonstrated by Dec 31, 2026.'
